# # Introduction

# ## What is NLP?
# 
# * Building computer systems that **understand** and **generate** natural languages.
# * Deep understanding of **broad** language
#     * not just string processing or keyword matching
#     

# Can you think of NLP Applications?

# ## Speech Recognition
# 
# Speech Recognition is usually not considered NLP. We will not cover this topic here.

# "Jane ate spaghetti with a **silver spoon**."

# Do you mean...

# Jane used a silver spoon to eat spaghetti? (**cutlery**)

# Jane had spaghetti and a silver spoon? (**part**)

# Jane exhibited a silver spoon while eating spaghetti? (**manner**)

# Jane ate spaghetti in the presence of a silver spoon? (**company**)
