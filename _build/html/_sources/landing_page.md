# Welcome to NDAK18000U (Natural Language Processing) course!


Have you ever wondered how to build a system that can process, understand or generate text automatically? For instance, to translate between languages, answer questions, or recognise the names of people in text? Then this course is for you.

This course will introduce the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP), i.e., computational models of language and their applications to text. Language is at the heart of human intelligence, giving NLP a central role in Artificial Intelligence research and development.

We will combine machine learning (ML), including fundamental formalisms and algorithms, with a strong hands-on experience, i.e., the practical implementation of the methods for concrete NLP problems.

The course will utilise interactive lecture materials built with Jupyter notebook. Course materials from last year are publicly available here: https://github.com/copenlu/stat-nlp-book; and the course will closely follow last yearâ€™s iteration. Please skim these materials if you are in doubt about course prerequisites or course content.

 

The course covers the following tentative topic list:

1. NLP tasks: language modelling, text classification, semantics, information extraction, parsing, pragmatics, machine translation, summarisation, question answering
2. methods: text classification, structured prediction, representation and deep learning, conditional random fields, beam search
3. implementations: relationship between NLP tasks, efficient implementations

Throughout the course, we will also discuss the themes of discriminative and generative learning and different ways of obtaining supervision for training statistical NLP models.
